# The Citylearn simulation

In this document we can collect all insight that we gain on the citylearn framework. Just a trivial example below:

## Buildings properties
In `data/citylearn_challenge_2021/schema.json`, the configuration of each building is stored under
`buildings -> Building_N`
E.g. the nominal pv power is stored in `buildings -> Building_N -> pv -> attributes -> nominal_power`.
